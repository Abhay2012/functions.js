# Contributing
 To this project, you can contribute by sending pull requests for new functions that might solve some problem or reduce the complexity of a problem.

### Guide for new functions
 
-  The function should be created in <code>src/{category}/functions/{filename.js}</code>. Add the function names to <code>category.js</code> and <code>allfunctions.js</code>.

- While adding the function names to above mentioned files, make sure to maintain the alphabetical order.

- The function should be explained above the function declaration itself with the help of multi-line comments. 

- The code written should be preferably in **ES6** standard.

- Be sure to test the function before making a pull request.
