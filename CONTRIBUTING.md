# Contributing ✏️
 To this project, you can contribute by sending pull requests for new functions that might solve some problem or reduce the complexity of a problem.

### Guide for new functions
 
-  The function should be created in <code>src/{category}/functions/{filename.js}</code>. Add the function names to <code>category.js</code> and <code>allfunctions.js</code>.

- While adding the function names to above mentioned files, make sure to maintain the **alphabetical order**.

- The function should be explained above the function declaration itself with the help of **JSDOC**. 

- The code written should be preferably in **ES6** standard.

- Be sure to **test** the function before making a pull request. 

- If you have a new category to be included, feel free to make a pull request.
